<b><a name="q1">1. What is consignment? How Does it work?</a><br><br></b>



Consignment is simple: 1) bring in your used textbooks (we also take iClickers) 2) fill out a contract and set your own prices 3) we'll sell your books for you in our store. If your books are sold, you will receive 80% of the sales price and the other 20% will be donated to the BC Children's Hospital. If your books are not sold, we will return them to you NO CHARGE. <br /><br />

<b><a name="q2">2. Why should I consign my books to iBU?</a><br /><br /></b>



It saves you the time and effort of finding buyers and advertising. You'll make more money than using the textbook buyback from the campus bookstores. You'll contribute to raising funds for the BC Children's Hospital. <br /><br />

<b><a name="q3">3. What's the difference between iBU and some other online textbook-exchange website?</a><br /><br /></b>


We have the same goal of saving money on textbooks and getting more money back than using textbook buyback services. While the online websites act as an interface where you can view ads, iBU provides an in person service. Instead of contacting buyers/sellers and arranging meeting times and locations several times, you can save the time by bringing your books to iBU. Just fill out a contract with your textbook information and set your own price. We'll do the work of selling it for you.<br /><br />

<b><a name="q4">4. Will iBU keep my personal information confidential? </a><br /><br /></b>


We definitely will. iBU just needs your personal information to contact you about important dates, such as pick up dates at the end of each sales session. Your student number acts as another form of identification in case you lose your copy of the contract or forget to bring it with you. Your year of study and faculty will not be attached to your name and will help us increase sales and thus increasing funds to the BC Children's Hospital.  <br /><br />

<b><a name="q5">5. Do buyers also benefit from using iBU?</a><br /><br /></b>



Yes. All the used textbooks are encouraged to be priced at around 70% or lower of the books original price. This is always cheaper than the bookstore.  <br /><br />

<b><a name="q6">6. What kind of books can I consign?</a><br /><br /></b>



We accept books that are being used in the current academic term. Older editions will also be accepted, but it will be difficult to sell them unless you are willing to sell them for bargain prices. We may accept novels or reference books for bargain prices, but due to space considerations we may have to limit these. <br /><br />

<b><a name="q7">7. How do I get my money?</a><br /><br /></b>



You can pick up your cheque from the iBU store at the end of a sales session. We will contact you by email or text message to remind you of these dates. Just remember to bring your copy of the contract and/or student ID to pick up your money.<br /><br />

<b><a name="q8">8. How do I pay?</a><br /><br /></b>



We only accept cash payments. However, there are several ATM machines in the SUB and a BMO ATM machine beside SUB 42V for your convenience.<br /><br />

<b><a name="q9">9. I bought the wrong book, can I return it?</a><br /><br /></b>


Unfortunately, due to the nature of consignment sales we cannot give refunds, exchanges, or returns on consigned (used) books. You are welcome to re-consign the book. Before you buy a book, please be sure that it is the correct book for your section and course! Some sections of the same course will use different books!<br /><br />

<b><a name="q10">10. What happens if I lost my contract?</a><br /><br /></b>


As long as you filled in your student ID on the contract and have your student card with you, you can still get your books and money.<br /><br />

<b><a name="q11">11. What if I'm out of town and can't pick up my books/money? Can I get a friend to pick it up for me?</a><br><br></b>
Yes, you can. Just send us an email or Facebook message iBookUnion UBC and let us know ahead of time. In the message please include: 1) your contract number or student number 2) the name of your friend who's picking it up for you 3) your friend's contact information (email, cell phone number, and student number). <br /><br />

Make sure the person picking up your books and/or money has your contract or student number and their own student card. We need their student card to verify they've been authorized by you to pick up your books and/or money.<br><br>
