Want to get rid of your old textbooks or are you finding a cheap textbook? Do you want to make some money while also donating to a good cause? iBookUnion is the place for you!

iBU is a student-run, non-profit group that sells your used textbooks to other students. If you give us your books, you can set a price and if it is sold by us in September, you'll get 80% of the selling price. The remaining 20% goes towards BC Children's Hospital!
